My name is Nikita Kostin, I'm a Research Scientist at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. 

My research interests include Safety and Robustness of Reinforcement Learning algorithms, as well as their applications in Robotics.
Currently, I'm working on the problem of safe exploration in Reinforcement Learning without any prior knowledge.
Recently, I have been working on the problem of zero-shot adaptation of Robust Reinforcement Learning algorithms to new environments.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Researcher at the Huawei Research Center in Moscow, where I investigated computer vision algorithms for image enhancement and segmentation tasks.
I received my M.Sc. in Applied from Lomonosov Moscow State University in 2020 and my B.Sc. in Physics from Physics Faculty of Lomonosov Moscow State University in 2018. 

For my free time, I enjoy doing different sports, such as cross-country skiing, cycling and swimming. Also, I like to play chess, my ELO rating is oscillating around 1900.
