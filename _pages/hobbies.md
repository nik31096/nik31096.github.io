Cross-country skiing
======
The most amazing winter activity I'm aware of is cross-country skiing! That's right, not alpine skiing or snowboarding!

To prove my point, imagine an ordinary person wanting to spend some active and healthy time outside during winter with a limited budget and limited time. In most northern countries such activity can only be cross-country skiing: 
* Equipment is cheap and easy to get.
* Most cities have a public transportation to the tracks.
* It's super healthy and really demanding, but you will be super-proud of yourself after completing the training!
